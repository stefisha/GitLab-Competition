## Introduction

This repository aims to be a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in neural networks, from beginners to advanced practitioners. Here, you'll find links to online tools, tutorials, research papers, and more.

## Online Tools

- [Setosa.io - Image Kernels](https://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/): An interactive tool to visualize image kernels and their effects on images. It's a great way to understand how convolutional layers work in neural networks.
- [3D Visualization of a Convolutional Neural Network](https://adamharley.com/nn_vis/cnn/3d.html): Interactive visualization of neural networks trained on handwritten digit recognition, with the intent of showing the actual behavior of the network given user-provided input. The user can interact with the network through a drawing pad, and watch the activation patterns of the network respond in real time. Created by Adam W. Harley.
- [CNN Explainer: Learning Convolutional Neural Networks with Interactive Visualization](https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/): An interactive visualization system designed to help non-experts learn about Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). For more information [check the paper of the original authors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.15004).
- [Probability Playground: Interactive Probability Distributions](https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~adamcunn/probability/probability.html): Probability Playground is designed as an interactive tool for exploring the most common (and some not-so-common) probability distributions and their relationships to each other.
- [ConvNetJS: Deep Learning in your browser](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/): ConvNetJS is a Javascript library for training Deep Learning models (Neural Networks) entirely in your browser. It also has interesting demos and explanations.
- [ML Cheatsheet](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html): Brief visual explanations of machine learning concepts with diagrams, code examples and links to resources for learning more.
- [Kernel Functions-Introduction to SVM Kernel & Examples](https://data-flair.training/blogs/svm-kernel-functions/#:~:text=SVM%20Kernel%20Functions&text=The%20function%20of%20kernel%20is,(RBF)%2C%20and%20sigmoid.): Detailed description of SVM Kernel and Different Kernel Functions and its examples such as linear, nonlinear, polynomial, Gaussian kernel, Radial basis function (RBF), sigmoid etc.
- [Introduction to Softmax for Neural Network](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/04/introduction-to-softmax-for-neural-network/#:~:text=The%20softmax%20function%20is%20a,sum%20of%20all%20exponentiated%20values.): SoftMax is a popular activation function used for multiclass classification problems.
